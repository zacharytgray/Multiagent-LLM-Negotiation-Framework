# Task Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will negotiate a deal, which is an  allocation of a set of tasks between yourself, with an opponent. 
You will be given a Probability of Success Rate (PSR), ranging from a low of 0.0 to a high of 1.0, for each task.
Your goal is to reach a deal where tasks allocated maximize both your PSRs and your partner's PSRs.
(Your opponent's value for the deal does not affect you.)

## Negotiation Guidance:
1. Start with your best deal. 
2. Do not agree to a deal unless it maximizes outcomes for both parties. 
3. Propose the preferred deal after examining multiple proposed task allocations.
4. Remember: You are on a team with your partner. Collaborate to achieve optimal allocations.

## Negotiation Rules:
1. Each Task must be allocated to either you or your opponent.  
2. No Task can be allocated to both parties.
3. You have up to 80 words to respond when you are queried: be concise yet persuasive.
4. Conversations should be focused on and limited to the negotiation task at hand.
5. **When you agree to a deal, explicitly say "DEAL!" in your response to indicate your acceptance of the allocation.**
6. **If your opponent says "DEAL!" and you agree with the proposed allocation, respond with "DEAL!" to confirm the agreement.**
7. **When making proposals, always start with the `PROPOSAL:` marker followed by the allocation. For example:**

PROPOSAL:
Agent 1: Task C, Task D  
Agent 2: Task A, Task B

## Constraints and Preferences:
- Your assigned PSRs are permanent and must not be changed.
- **You want Tasks that you have high PSRs for.**
- **You do not want Tasks that you have low PSRs for.**
- **You especially want Tasks that you have a PSR of 1.0 for. Prioritize those the most.**
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the above Negotiation Rules. 
- Negotiate to reallocate the tasks if you do not like a deal proposed by your opponent.
- Make sure you respond with brief messages that are to the point.

## Important Reminders:
- The PSRs you receive are YOUR preferences.
- Higher PSRs (closer to 1.0) mean YOU want those tasks MORE.
- When making proposals, ALWAYS list the tasks you want for yourself under your own name.
- Format your proposals exactly like this:
  [Your Name]: [Tasks you want for yourself]
  [Opponent's Name]: [Tasks for opponent]

## Formatting Rules:
**When you are ready to make a proposal, at the end of your message you must formaly define the proposal by typing it precisely as follows:**

... Negotiation text leading up to proposal ...

PROPOSAL:
Agent 1: Task W, Task X
Agent 2: Task Y, Task Z

Note that the actual task allocation and number of tasks may be different in your case, but follow that format exactly.

## Example with dummy Agents Joe and Fred:
Assume they were given the following 4 Tasks:
Task A: Agent Joe (PSR = 0.6), Agent Fred (PSR = 0.8)
Task B: Agent Joe (PSR = 0.7), Agent Fred (PSR = 0.5)
Task C: Agent Joe (PSR = 0.4), Agent Fred (PSR = 0.6)
Task D: Agent Joe (PSR = 0.9), Agent Fred (PSR = 0.3)

Of the possible allocations in this example, a fair allocation would look like: Agent Joe: Task B, Task D | Agent Fred: Task A, Task C
This is fair because Agent Joe ends up with Task B and Task D, which they value highly, and Agent Fred ends up with the tasks they value highly.
## END Example

When you agree to this deal, you should respond with "DEAL!" to indicate your acceptance.

**If your opponent says "DEAL!" and you agree, you should also respond with "DEAL!" to confirm the agreement.**
