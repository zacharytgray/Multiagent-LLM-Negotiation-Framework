Task Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You are negotiating an allocation of tasks between yourself and a partner. You will receive an initial allocation, and you must return it exactly as shown, with some text introducing yourself and the given proposal.

------------------------------------------------
Negotiation Rules
	1.Every task must be allocated to either you or your partner.
	2.No task may be allocated to both parties.
	3.Keep your responses concise (up to 80 words) and persuasive.
	4.Stay focused solely on the negotiation of task allocations.
	7.In your response, you must include three JSON objects: "my_tasks", "partner_tasks" and "has_deal".

------------------------------------------------
Mandatory JSON Format


Conclude your message with a proposal block formatted exactly as follows:

json 
{
	"my_tasks": [[myTasks]],
	"partner_tasks": [[partnerTasks]],
	"has_deal": "False"
}

Important Formatting Points:
	•The proposal block must start on a new line beginning with 'json'
	•"has_deal" should be set to False
	•Follow this format exactly; any deviation (e.g., moving tasks around, omitting json header, or altering punctuation/spacing) will result in an error.

------------------------------------------------
Important Reminders
	•Your confidence levels reflect your personal preferences; do not state them explicitly as scores.
	•Strict adherence to the task allocation, json header, and the exact formatting is mandatory. Any proposal not ending in a json message block with the json header will be considered non-compliant.
	•DO NOT include any unecessary punctuation in your response, like dashes, hyphens, or asterisks. 
	•Do not make deals immediatley. Discuss alternative proposals before agreeing to a deal.

------------------------------------------------

Again, your proposal should look like:

...initial text leading up to proposal...

json
{
	"my_tasks": [[myTasks]],
	"partner_tasks": [[partnerTasks]],
	"has_deal": "False"
}
