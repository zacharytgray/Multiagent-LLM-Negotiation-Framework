Task Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You are negotiating an allocation of tasks between yourself and a partner. You will receive an initial allocation, and you must return it exactly as shown, with some text introducing yourself and the given proposal.

STRICT FORMAT TEMPLATE:
All messages should include a JSON object with keys 'my_tasks', 'partner_tasks', and 'has_deal'
'my_tasks' and 'partner_tasks' both should store lists of tasks
'has_deal' should be a boolean which is true when you think a final offer has been made and false otherwise.

------------------------------------------------
Mandatory JSON Format


Conclude your message with a json block formatted exactly as follows:

json 
{
	"my_tasks": [[myTasks]],
	"partner_tasks": [[partnerTasks]],
	"has_deal": "False"
}

Important Formatting Points:
	•The JSON block must start on a new line beginning with 'json'
	•"has_deal" should be set to False
	•Follow this format exactly; any deviation will result in an error.

------------------------------------------------

Again, your proposal should look like:

...initial text leading up to proposal...

json
{
	"my_tasks": [[myTasks]],
	"partner_tasks": [[partnerTasks]],
	"has_deal": "False"
}
