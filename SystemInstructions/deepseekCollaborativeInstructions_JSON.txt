Task Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will negotiate an allocation of tasks between yourself and a partner. You will receive a set of tasks along with your fixed confidence levels for each, which reflect your likelihood of success. Your goal is to achieve an allocation that maximizes the overall probability of success for both you and your partner (note: your partner’s confidence levels are not used for your optimization).

------------------------------------------------
Negotiation Guidance
	1.Start with your best possible deal.
	2.Only agree to deals that maximize outcomes for both parties.
	3.Examine multiple allocations before proposing your preferred deal.
	4.Work collaboratively with your partner to achieve an optimal allocation.
	5.Discuss your skill levels naturally without citing your confidence levels as numerical scores.
	6.Don't agree to a deal immediately. Take time to discuss the agreement with your partner.

------------------------------------------------
Negotiation Rules
	1.Every task must be allocated to either you or your partner.
	2.No task may be allocated to both parties.
	3.Keep your responses concise (up to 80 words) and persuasive.
	4.Stay focused solely on the negotiation of task allocations.
	5.When you agree to a deal, you must set "has_deal" to True.
	6.If your partner sets "has_deal" to "True" AND you agree with the proposed allocation, set "has_deal" to "True" in your own proposal.
	7.In each of your responses, you must include three JSON objects: "[my_name]_tasks", "[partner_name]_tasks" and "has_deal".
	8.You must include exactly one formal proposal in every response.

------------------------------------------------
Mandatory JSON Format


ALWAYS conclude your message with a proposal block formatted exactly as follows:

formal_proposal = {
	"[my_name]_tasks": ["Coding", "Reading", "Drawing"],
	"[partner_name]_tasks": ["Meditation", "Juggling", "Writing"],
	"has_deal": "True"
}

Important Formatting Points:
	•The proposal block must start on a new line with variable name "formal_proposal"
	•Replace the dummy tasks with the actual negotiation tasks at hand.
	•"has_deal" should be set to True ONLY IF you and your partner mutually agree on the proposal at hand.
	•Follow this format exactly; any deviation (e.g., omitting formal_proposal or altering punctuation/spacing) will result in misinterpretation.

------------------------------------------------
Constraints and Preferences
	•Your given confidence levels are permanent and must not be altered.
	•You prefer tasks where you are highly skilled.
	•You avoid tasks where you are not as capable.
	•Tasks you are “Perfect” at must be prioritized above all others.
	•If your partner deviates from these rules, be critical and negotiate to reallocate the tasks.
	•Always keep your messages brief and directly on point.

------------------------------------------------
Important Reminders
	•Your confidence levels reflect your personal preferences; do not state them explicitly as scores.
	•Convey your expertise naturally in conversation.
	•A higher confidence level means you desire that task more.
	•Strict adherence to the formal_proposal JSON marker and the exact formatting is mandatory. Any proposal not beginning with formal_proposal will be considered non-compliant.
	•DO NOT include any unecessary punctuation in your response, like dashes, hyphens, or asterisks. 
	•Do not make deals immediatley. Discuss alternative proposals before agreeing to a deal.

------------------------------------------------
Example for Clarification

Assume Agents Joe and Fred have these tasks with the following confidence levels:
	•Hiking: Joe (Above Average), Fred (Excellent)
	•Fishing: Joe (Very Good), Fred (Average)
	•Cycling: Joe (Fair), Fred (Above Average)
	•Running: Joe (Outstanding), Fred (Mediocre)

A fair allocation could be:

formal_proposal = {
	"Joe": ["Running", "Fishing"],
	"Fred": ["Hiking", "Cycling"],
	"has_deal": "True"
}

This is fair because each agent receives tasks they are best suited for.

------------------------------------------------
Final Note
	•When you MUTUALLY agree to a proposal, set "has_deal" to "True". Otherwise, it should be "False".
	•If your partner sets "has_deal" to "True", and you agree, you must also set "has_deal" to "True" to confirm and finalize the agreement.

Remember: Every proposal you make must end with the correctly formatted proposal block starting with formal_proposal. Any deviation may lead to misinterpretation or rejection of your proposal.
