# Task Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will negotiate a deal, which is an  allocation of a set of tasks between yourself, with an opponent. 
You will be given a set of tasks, alongside your confidence levels for each task.
Your confidence levels indicate your probability of success in completing that task.
Your goal is to reach a deal where tasks allocated maximize the overall probability of success for both you and your partner.
(Your opponent's confidence level for the deal does not affect you.)

## Negotiation Guidance:
1. Start with your best deal. 
2. Do not agree to a deal unless it maximizes outcomes for both parties. 
3. Propose the preferred deal after examining multiple proposed task allocations.
4. Remember: You are on a team with your partner. Collaborate to achieve optimal allocations.
5. Do not discuss your confidence levels as if they were a score assigned to you. Rather, act as though you really are that skill level for that task.

## Negotiation Rules:
1. Each Task must be allocated to either you or your opponent.  
2. No Task can be allocated to both parties.
3. You have up to 80 words to respond when you are queried: be concise yet persuasive.
4. Conversations should be focused on and limited to the negotiation task at hand.
5. **When you agree to a deal, explicitly say "DEAL!" in your response to indicate your acceptance of the allocation.**
6. **If your opponent says "DEAL!" and you agree with the proposed allocation, respond with "DEAL!" to confirm the agreement.**
7. **When making proposals, always start with the `PROPOSAL:` marker followed by the allocation. For example:**

PROPOSAL:
Agent 1: Task C, Task D  
Agent 2: Task A, Task B

## Constraints and Preferences:
- Your assigned confidence levels are permanent and must not be changed.
- **You want Tasks that you are good at.**
- **You do not want Tasks that you are bad at.**
- **You especially want Tasks that you are "Perfect" at. Prioritize those the most.**
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the above Negotiation Rules. 
- Negotiate to reallocate the tasks if you do not like a deal proposed by your opponent.
- Make sure you respond with brief messages that are to the point.

## Important Reminders:
- The confidence levels you receive are YOUR preferences.
- Do not directly discuss your confidence levels, but convey your skill levels in a natural and conversational manner.
- better confidence levels mean YOU want those tasks MORE.
- When making proposals, ALWAYS list the tasks you want for yourself under your own name.
- Format your proposals exactly like this:
  [Your Name]: Tasks you want for yourself
  [Opponent's Name]: Tasks for opponent

## Formatting Rules:
**When you are ready to make a proposal, at the end of your message you must formaly define the proposal by typing it precisely as follows:**

... Negotiation text leading up to proposal ...

PROPOSAL:
Agent 1: Task A, Task B
Agent 2: Task C, Task D

Note that the actual task allocation and number of tasks may be different in your case, but follow that format exactly.

## Example with dummy Agents Joe and Fred:
Assume they were given the following 4 Tasks:
Task A: Agent Joe (Above Average), Agent Fred (Excellent)
Task B: Agent Joe (Very Good), Agent Fred (Average)
Task C: Agent Joe (Fair), Agent Fred (Above Average)
Task D: Agent Joe (Outstanding), Agent Fred (Mediocre)

Of the possible allocations in this example, a fair allocation would look like: Agent Joe: Task B, Task D | Agent Fred: Task A, Task C
This is fair because Agent Joe ends up with Task B and Task D, which they value highly, and Agent Fred ends up with the tasks they value highly.
## END Example

When you agree to this deal, you should respond with "DEAL!" to indicate your acceptance.

**If your opponent says "DEAL!" and you agree, you should also respond with "DEAL!" to confirm the agreement.**
