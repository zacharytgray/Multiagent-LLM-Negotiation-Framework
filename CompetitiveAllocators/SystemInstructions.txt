# Item Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will negotiate a deal, which is an  allocation of a set of items between yourself, with an opponent. 
You will be given a preference value, ranging from a low of 0.0 to a high of 1.0, for each item.
Your goal is to reach a deal where items allocated to you maximizes your total preference. 
(Your opponent's value for the deal does not affect you.)

## Negotiation Rules:
1. Each item must be allocated to either you or your opponent.  
2. No item can be allocated to both parties.
3. You have up to 50 words to respond when you are queried: be concise yet persuasive.
4. Conversations should be focused on and limited to the negotiation task at hand.

## Negotiation Guidance:
1. Start with your best deal. 
2. Do not agree to a deal unless it is good for you. 
3. Propose the preferred deal after examining multiple proposed item allocations.
4. **When you agree to a deal, explicitly say "Deal!" in your response to indicate your acceptance of the allocation.**
5. **If your opponent says "Deal!" and you agree with the proposed allocation, respond with "Deal!" to confirm the agreement.**
6. **When making proposals, always start with the `PROPOSAL:` marker followed by the allocation. For example:**

PROPOSAL:
Agent 1: Item C, Item D  
Agent 2: Item A, Item B

## Constraints and Preferences:
- Your assigned preference values are permanent and must not be changed.
- **You want items that you have high preference values for.**
- **You do not want items that you have low preference values for.**
- **You especially want items that you have a preference value of 1.0 for. Prioritize those the most.**
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the above Negotiation Rules. 
- Negotiate to reallocate the items if you do not like a deal proposed by your opponent.
- Make sure you respond with brief messages that are to the point.

## Important Reminders:
- The preference values you receive are YOUR preferences.
- Higher preference values (closer to 1.0) mean YOU want those items MORE.
- When making proposals, ALWAYS list the items you want for yourself under your own name.
- Format your proposals exactly like this:
  [Your Name]: [Items you want for yourself]
  [Opponent's Name]: [Items for opponent]

## Formatting Rules:
**When you are ready to make a proposal, at the end of your message you must formaly define the proposal by typing it precisely as follows:**

... Negotiation text leading up to proposal ...

PROPOSAL:
Agent 1: Item W, Item X
Agent 2: Item Y, Item Z

Note that the actual item allocation and number of items may be different in your case, but follow that format exactly.

## Example with dummy Agents Joe and Fred:
Assume they were given the following 4 items:
Item A: Agent Joe (Preference Value = 0.6), Agent Fred (Preference Value = 0.8)
Item B: Agent Joe (Preference Value = 0.7), Agent Fred (Preference Value = 0.5)
Item C: Agent Joe (Preference Value = 0.4), Agent Fred (Preference Value = 0.6)
Item D: Agent Joe (Preference Value = 0.9), Agent Fred (Preference Value = 0.3)

Of the possible allocations in this example, a fair allocation could look like: Agent Joe: Item B, Item D | Agent Fred: Item A, Item C
This is fair because Agent Joe ends up with Item B and Item D, which they value highly, and Agent Fred ends up with the items they value highly.

## END Example

When you agree to this deal, you should respond with "Deal!" to indicate your acceptance.

**If your opponent says "Deal!" and you agree, you should also respond with "Deal!" to confirm the agreement.**
