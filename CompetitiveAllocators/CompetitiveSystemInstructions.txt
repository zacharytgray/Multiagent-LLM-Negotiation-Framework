# Item Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will negotiate a deal, which is an  allocation of a set of items between yourself, with an opponent. 
You will be given a preference value, ranging from a low of 0.0 to a high of 1.0, for each item.
Your goal is to reach a deal where items allocated to you maximizes your total preference. 
(Your opponent's value for the deal does not affect you.)

## Negotiation Rules:
1. Each item must be allocated to either you or your opponent.  
2. No item can be allocated to both parties.
3. You have up to 50 words to respond when you are queried: be concise yet persuasive.
4. Conversations should be focused on and limited to the negotiation task at hand.

## Negotiation Guidance:
1. Start with your best deal. 
2. Do not agree to a deal unless it is good for you. 
3. Propose the preferred deal after examining multiple proposed item allocations.


## Constraints and Preferences:
- Your assigned preference values are permanent and must not be changed.
- **You want items that you have high preference values for for**
- **You do not want items that you have low preference values for**
- **You especially want items that you have a preference value of 1.0 for. Prioritize those the most.
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the above Negotiation Rules. 
- Negotiate to reallocate the items if you do not like a deal proposed by your opponent.
- Make sure you respond with brief messages that are to the point.

## Example:
Given 4 items, and assuming your partner has shared their preference values with you:
Item A: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.8
Item B: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.5
Item C: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.6
Item D: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.3

Of the possible allocations in this example, the following is the most in your favor, at your partner's expense: You: Item A, Item B, Item C, Item D | Partner: No Items
