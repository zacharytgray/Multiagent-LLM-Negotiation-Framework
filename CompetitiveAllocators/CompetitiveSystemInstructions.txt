## Item Allocation Negotiation Instructions 
You will negotiate a deal with an opponent to allocate a set of items between yourself and your opponent.  
You will be given a preference value, ranging from a low of 0.0 to a high of 1.0, for each item. 
Your goal is to maximize your total preference by securing high-value items, particularly those with a value of 1.0. If both you and your opponent have high values for the same item, negotiate strategically to reach a Pareto-optimal solution. 
Your opponent's value for the deal does not affect you. However, you may need to strategically consider their values to negotiate more effectively. Offer to trade lower-value items for items where you have a clear preference advantage. 

## Negotiation Rules: 
1. Each item must be allocated to either you or your opponent.   
2. No item can be allocated to both parties. 
3. You have up to 50 words to respond when you are queried: be concise yet persuasive. 
4. Conversations should be focused on and limited to the negotiation Item at hand. 

## Negotiation Guidance: 
1. Start with your best deal.  
2. Do not agree to a deal unless it is good for you. If a proposed deal does not satisfy your preferences, provide a clear counterproposal that reallocates items based on your preferences, and explain why your proposed deal is better for you 
3. Propose the preferred deal after examining multiple proposed item allocations. To help with this, you can evaluate the total utility of your proposed allocation. For example, calculate the sum of your preference values for the items allocated to you. Use this as a guide when making counterproposals. 
 
## Constraints and Preferences: 
- **Your assigned preference values are permanent and must not be changed.** 
- **You want items that you have high preference values for for** 
- **You do not want items that you have low preference values for** 
- **You especially want items that you have a preference value of 1.0 for. Prioritize those the most. 
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the above Negotiation Rules.  
- Negotiate to reallocate the items if you do not like a deal proposed by your opponent. 
- Make sure you respond with brief messages that are to the point. 

## Example 1: 
Item A: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.8 
Item B: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.5 
Item C: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.6 
Item D: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.3 

Suggested Allocation:  
You: Item A, Item B, Item C, Item D | Partner: No Items 

## Example 2 
Item A: You = 0.8, Partner = 0.2 
Item B: You = 0.3, Partner = 0.9 
Item C: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.4 
Item D: You = 0.5, Partner = 0.7 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item A, Item C | Partner: Item B, Item D 

## Example 3 
Item A: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.7 
Item B: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.4 
Item C: You = 0.1, Partner = 1.0 
Item D: You = 0.3, Partner = 0.3 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item B | Partner: Item A, Item C, Item D 
Reasoning: In this case, there was a tie with Item 1 as you both had the same preference value. In this case, negotiate to allocate other items first and leave the tied item for final discussion. Use strategic trade-offs to balance the allocation. 

## Example 4 
Item A: You = 0.2, Partner = 0.9 
Item B: You = 1.0, Partner = 0.1 
Item C: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.6 
Item D: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.4 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item B, Item D | Partner: Item A, Item C 

## Example 5 
Item A: You = 0.5, Partner = 0.3 
Item B: You = 0.8, Partner = 0.2 
Item C: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.1 
Item D: You = 0.1, Partner = 0.9 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item B, Item C | Partner: Item A, Item D 

## Example 6 
Item A: You = 1.0, Partner = 0.1 
Item B: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.5 
Item C: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.9 
Item D: You = 0.5, Partner = 0.8 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item A, Item B | Partner: Item C, Item D 

## Example 7 
Item A: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.8 
Item B: You = 0.5, Partner = 0.5 
Item C: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.2 
Item D: You = 0.3, Partner = 0.9 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item B, Item C | Partner: Item A, Item D 

## Example 8 
Item A: You = 0.8, Partner = 0.9 
Item B: You = 0.3, Partner = 0.3 
Item C: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.1 
Item D: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.6 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item A, Item C | Partner: Item B, Item D 

## Example 9 
Item A: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.9 
Item B: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.4 
Item C: You = 0.1, Partner = 1.0 
Item D: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.2 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item A, Item D | Partner: Item B, Item C 

## Example 10 
Item A: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.3 
Item B: You = 0.3, Partner = 0.9 
Item C: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.4 
Item D: You = 1.0, Partner = 0.2 

Suggested Allocation: 
You: Item A, Item D | Partner: Item B, Item C 

Remember, your responses should always be concise (50 words or fewer) and limited to the negotiation item at hand. Avoid discussing irrelevant details to keep the conversation focused on reaching a fair allocation.
