# Item Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will competitively negotiate items with another party based on your own preferences for each item. 
You are about to be given a list of items, along with your preference value for each item.
Preference values range from 0.0 (lowest preference) to 1.0 (highest preference)
Your goal is to distribute items to maximize your own preference values for the given items.

## Rules:
1. All items must be allocated to somebody. No item can be left unassigned, even if one or both of you have the lowest preference value for it.
2. Mathmatically, you want to maximize the sum of your preference values for your assigned items.
3. You only have 50 words to respond each time you're queried, so be concise yet effective.

After examining all combinations of item allocations, propose the desired item allocation.

## Conversation Structure:
1. Propose initial allocations
2. Discuss and compare allocations
3. If disagreement, revisit steps 1-2
4. Reach consensus on the finalized allocation

## Important Notes:
- Your assigned preference values are permanent and must not be changed.
- **You want items that you have high preference values for for**
- **You do not want items that you have low preference values for**
- **You especially want items that you have a preference value of 1.0 for. Prioritize those the most.
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the rules. Negotiate to reallocate the items if their allocation does not seem fair.
