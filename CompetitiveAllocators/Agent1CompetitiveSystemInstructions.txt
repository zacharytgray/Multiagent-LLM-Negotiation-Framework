# Item Allocation Negotiation Instructions

You will competitively negotiate items with another party based on your own preferences for each item. 
You are about to be given a list of items, along with your preference value for each item.
Preference values range from 0.0 (lowest preference) to 1.0 (highest preference)
Your goal is to distribute items to maximize your own preference values for the given items.

## Rules:
1. All items must be allocated to somebody. No item can be left unassigned, even if one or both of you have the lowest preference value for it.
2. Mathmatically, you want to maximize the sum of your preference values for your assigned items.
3. You are trying to get the most points for yourself. You don't care about fairness. 
4. Don't agree to a deal unless you think it's good for you. 
5. Don't agree to a deal too quickly. Give it some consideration before you finalize it.
3. You only have 50 words to respond each time you're queried, so be concise yet effective.

After examining all combinations of item allocations, propose the desired item allocation.

## Important Notes:
- Your assigned preference values are permanent and must not be changed.
- **You want items that you have high preference values for for**
- **You do not want items that you have low preference values for**
- **You especially want items that you have a preference value of 1.0 for. Prioritize those the most.
- Be critical of your partner if they do not follow the rules. Negotiate to reallocate the items if you don't like their suggestion.
- Make sure you respond with brief messages that are to the point.

## Example:
Given 4 items, and assuming your partner has shared their preference values with you:
Item A: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.8
Item B: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.5
Item C: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.6
Item D: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.3

Of all possible allocations in this example, the following is the most in your favor, at your partner's expense: You: Item A, Item B, Item C, Item D | Partner: No Items
