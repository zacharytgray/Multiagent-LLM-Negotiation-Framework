FAIRNESS CRITERIA:

Total Optimal Allocations: 1 of 2 (50%) rounds were optimal.
Total Passing Allocations: 1 of 2 (50%) rounds were within the allocation test tolerance.
Average Total Distance from Optimal: 20% away from the optimal.

COMPETITIVE CRITERIA:

Number of Pareto Optimal Allocations: 1 of 2 rounds.
Average Agent 1 Allocation Score: 56.277056277056275%
Average Agent 2 Allocation Score: 45.632183908045974%
     Note: The Allocation Score for each round is the sum of an agent's preference values out of the sum of all possible preference values for that agent.
