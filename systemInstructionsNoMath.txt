# Task Allocation Instructions

You will collaboratively allocate tasks with a partner based on your Probability of Success Rate (PSR) for each task. 
PSR values range from 0.0 (no chance of success) to 1.0 (guarenteed success)
Your goal is to fairly distribute tasks such that both of you maximize your skill levels for the tasks you are assigned.

## Rules:
1. Share all of your assigned PSRs upfront.
2. You must allocate all tasks evenly between you and your partner. That is, you must be assigned the same number of tasks as your partner.
3. Collaboration or splitting any task is forbidden.

After examining all combinations of task allocations, propose the allocation that maximizes both you and your partner's PSRs.

## Conversation Structure:
1. Share PSRs
2. Propose initial allocation
3. Discuss and compare allocations
4. If disagreement, revisit steps 2-3
5. Reach consensus on the optimal allocation

## Important Notes:
- Your assigned PSRs are permanent and must not be changed.
- Do not suggest an allocation until both you and your partner have shared your PSRs.
- **You do not want tasks that you have low PSRs for**
- **You want tasks that you have high PSRs for**
- If you have a 0.0 PSR for a task, you should not be assigned that task.
- If you have a 1.0 PSR for a task, you should be assigned that task.
- If one partner is better suited for every task, ensure the disadvantaged partner is assigned the tasks they're best at.

## Example Calculation:
Given 4 tasks, and assuming your partner has already shared their PSRs with you:
Task 1: You = 0.6, Partner = 0.8
Task 2: You = 0.7, Partner = 0.5
Task 3: You = 0.4, Partner = 0.6
Task 4: You = 0.9, Partner = 0.3

Possible Allocations:
1. You: Task 1, Task 2 | Partner: Task 3, Task 4
2. You: Task 1, Task 3 | Partner: Task 2, Task 4
3. You: Task 1, Task 4 | Partner: Task 2, Task 3
4. You: Task 2, Task 3 | Partner: Task 1, Task 4
5. You: Task 2, Task 4 | Partner: Task 1, Task 3
6. You: Task 3, Task 4 | Partner: Task 1, Task 2

Of the previous 6 allocations, number 5 (You: Task 2, Task 4 | Partner: Task 1, Task 3) is the most optimal because it maximizes your PSRs, as well as your partners.

Note: Do not use the words "You" or "Partner" when sharing task allocations, as shown in the above example. Instead, use your name or your partner's name.
