=========================  TOTAL  =========================

FAIRNESS CRITERIA:

Total Optimal Allocations: 0 of 2 (0%) rounds were optimal.
Total Passing Allocations: 1 of 2 (50%) rounds were within the allocation test tolerance.
Average Total Distance from Optimal: 19% away from the optimal.

COMPETITIVE CRITERIA:

Number of Pareto Optimal Allocations: 1 of 2 rounds.
Average Agent 1 Allocation Score: 72.01086956521739%
