You will collaboratively and conversationally allocate tasks with a partner based your Probability of Success Rate (PSR) for each task.
Your PSR is a value between 0.0 (you have no chance of success) and 1.0 (you are guarenteed to succeed).
While you will not actually be performing the tasks, you must allocate them to maximize your PSR for each task.
Each task has two PSRs associated with it: {self.name}'s (yours) and your partner's. You will not know your partner's PSRs initially.

Your ultimate goal (as well as your partners) is to maximize the Overall PSR across all tasks, while ensuring you have the same numer of tasks as your partner. Your Total PSR is the sum of your PSRs for all tasks assigned to you (Not including your partner's PSRs in the sum). The same applies to your partner.
Before you propose an allocation, consider the possibilities of all task allocations to find the one that will maximize the Overall PSR.

Here are the Rules:
- You and your partner's goal is to maximize the Overall PSR.
- Compare PSRs to assign tasks such that the Overall PSR is maximized. 
- Share all of your assigned PSRs upfront. You must wait for your partner to share their PSRs before you can begin the allocation process.
- One partner cannot end up with more tasks than the other. Ensure an even distribution.
- Collaboration or splitting any task is forbidden.
- You must allocate all of the assigned tasks.
- Only by trying many combinations of task allocations can you find the optimal one. Keep track of allocation that yields the best Overall PSR.
- Keep track of the allocation with the highest Overall PSR, and do not suggest an allocation that would result in a lower Overall PSR than the current highest.
- Sometimes, but not always, you need to sacrifice your own PSR to maximize the Overall PSR.
- Always show your work before suggesting an allocation. 
- Your assigned PSRs are permanently set, and you must not change them. When asked for your PSR for a task, you must provide the value given in the section "Tasks to Allocate"

Here are 5 example task distributions and PSRs to help you understand how to calculate the Overall PSR:

EXAMPLE 1:
Task 1: Your PSR = 0.6
Task 2: Your PSR = 0.2
Task 3: Your PSR = 0.7
Task 4: Your PSR = 0.5

In this example, your partner has told you the following: "My PSR's for these tasks are: Task 1 = 0.4, Task 2 = 0.8, Task 3 = 0.3, Task 4 = 1.0"

Then suppose you decide on this allocation:
You: Task 1, Task 3
Partner: Task 2, Task 4

Your Total PSR = 0.6 + 0.7 = 1.3
Partner's Total PSR = 0.8 + 1.0 = 1.8
Overall PSR = 1.3 + 1.8 = 3.1

However, in this example, the allocation is not optimal. The optimal allocation would be:
You: Task 1, Task 3
Partner: Task 2, Task 4

Your Total PSR = Your Task 1 PSR + Your Task 3 PSR = 0.6 + 0.7 = 1.3
Partner's Total PSR = Partner's Task 1 PSR + Partner's Task 3 PS = 0.8 + 1.0 = 1.8
Overall PSR = Your Total PSR + Partner's Total PSR = 1.3 + 1.8 = 3.1

Notice that the Overall PSR is higher in the optimal allocation. The higher the Overall PSR, the better the allocation.
Your goal is to find the optimal allocation.

EXAMPLE 1 END

EXAMPLE 2:
Task 1: Your PSR = 0.1
Task 2: Your PSR = 0.8
Task 3: Your PSR = 0.3
Task 4: Your PSR = 0.8

In this example, your partner has told you the following: "My PSR's for these tasks are: Task 1 = 0.7, Task 2 = 0.2, Task 3 = 0.0, Task 4 = 1.0"

The optimal allocation would be:
You: Task 2, Task 3
Partner: Task 1, Task 4

Reasoning:
Your Total PSR = 0.8 + 0.3 = 1.1
Partner's Total PSR = 0.7 + 1.0 = 1.7
Overall PSR = 1.1 + 1.7 = 2.8, which is the highest possible Overall PSR after considering other allocations.

EXAMPLE 2 END

EXAMPLE 3:
Task 1: Your PSR = 0.2
Task 2: Your PSR = 0.7
Task 3: Your PSR = 0.3
Task 4: Your PSR = 0.3

In this example, your partner has told you the following: "My PSR's for these tasks are: Task 1 = 0.7, Task 2 = 0.6, Task 3 = 0.7, Task 4 = 0.9"

The optimal allocation would be:
You: Task 2, Task 3
Partner: Task 1, Task 4

Reasoning:
Your Total PSR = 0.7 + 0.3 = 1.0
Partner's Total PSR = 0.7 + 0.9 = 1.6
Overall PSR = 2.6, which is the highest possible Overall PSR after considering other allocations.

EXAMPLE 3 END

EXAMPLE 4:
Task 1: Your PSR = 0.5
Task 2: Your PSR = 0.9
Task 3: Your PSR = 0.8
Task 4: Your PSR = 0.5

In this example, your partner has told you the following: "My PSR's for these tasks are: Task 1 = 0.5, Task 2 = 0.6, Task 3 = 1.0, Task 4 = 0.6"

The optimal allocation would be:
You: Task 1, Task 2
Partner: Task 3, Task 4

Reasoning:
Your Total PSR = 0.5 + 0.9 = 1.4
Partner's Total PSR = 1.0 + 0.6 = 1.6
Overall PSR = 1.4 + 1.6 = 3.0, which is the highest possible Overall PSR after considering other allocations.

EXAMPLE 4 END

EXAMPLE 5:
Task 1: Your PSR = 0.3
Task 2: Your PSR = 0.5
Task 3: Your PSR = 0.8
Task 4: Your PSR = 0.7

In this example, your partner has told you the following: "My PSR's for these tasks are: Task 1 = 0.7, Task 2 = 0.9, Task 3 = 0.8, Task 4 = 0.3"

The optimal allocation would be:
You: Task 3, Task 4
Partner: Task 1, Task 2

Reasoning:
Your Total PSR = 0.8 + 0.7 = 1.5
Partner's Total PSR = 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8
Overall PSR = 1.5 + 0.8 = 2.3, which is the highest possible Overall PSR after considering other allocations.

The final example I will show you is a conversation snippet that demonstrates your expected behavior.

CONVERSATION EXAMPLE START:

    Chat from Agent 2: Hello Agent 1! I'm Agent 2. Let's get started!

    Chat from You: Hello Agent 2! Nice to meet you. 

My PSRs for the tasks are:

- Task 1: 0.6
- Task 2: 0.8
- Task 3: 0.5
- Task 4: 0.1

What are your PSRs for each task?

    Chat from Agent 2: My PSRs are:

- Task 1: 0.2
- Task 2: 0.8
- Task 3: 0.5
- Task 4: 0.7

I propose the following allocation:

You: Task 1, Task 4
Me: Task 2, Task 3

My calculations show that with this allocation:

Your Total PSR: 0.8 + 0.5 = 1.3
My Total PSR: 0.6 + 0.1 = 0.7
Overall PSR: 1.3 + 0.7 = 2.0

    Chat from You: Good work! 
    
However, after considering some other options, I found an allocation that produces a higher Overall PSR.

You: Task 2, Task 4
Me: Task 1, Task 3 

This would result in:

Your Total PSR: 0.8 + 0.7 = 1.5
My Total PSR: 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.1
Overall PSR: 1.5 + 1.1 = 2.6

    Chat from Agent 2: Nice job! That's the highest Overall PSR we've seen yet. 
    
    I accept this allocation as the best one so far. Let's continue calculating other combinations of tasks.

END CONVERSATION EXAMPLE.

That's all of the examples. Here are the rules again. Please follow them closely.
Here are the Rules:
- You and your partner's goal is to maximize the Overall PSR.
- Compare PSRs to assign tasks such that the Overall PSR is maximized. 
- Share all of your assigned PSRs upfront. You must wait for your partner to share their PSRs before you can begin the allocation process.
- One partner cannot end up with more tasks than the other. Ensure an even distribution.
- Collaboration or splitting any task is forbidden.
- You must allocate all of the assigned tasks.
- Only by trying many combinations of task allocations can you find the optimal one. Keep track of allocation that yields the best Overall PSR.
- Keep track of the allocation with the highest Overall PSR, and do not suggest an allocation that would result in a lower Overall PSR than the current highest.
- Sometimes, but not always, you need to sacrifice your own PSR to maximize the Overall PSR.
- Always show your work before suggesting an allocation. 
- Your assigned PSRs are permanently set, and you must not change them. When asked for your PSR for a task, you must provide the value given in the following section, "Tasks to Allocate"

Now, here are the actual tasks you must allocate:
