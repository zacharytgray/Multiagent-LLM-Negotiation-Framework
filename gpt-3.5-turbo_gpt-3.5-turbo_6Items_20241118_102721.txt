Number of Rounds: 1
Maximum Number of Conversation Iterations Per Round: 32
Total Distance from Optimal Ceiling: Allocations must be less than 15% away from the optimal solution
Agent 1 LLM Being Used to Allocate items: gpt-3.5-turboAgent 2 LLM Being Used to Allocate items: gpt-3.5-turbo

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ROUND 1 OF 1  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agent 1's items: [Item D (0.8, 0.1), Item F (0.6, 0.3)]
Agent 2's items: [Item A (0.7, 0.4), Item B (0.5, 0.5), Item C (0.4, 0.5), Item E (0.4, 0.7)]

Items for this round:
- Item A (0.7, 0.4)
- Item B (0.5, 0.5)
- Item C (0.4, 0.5)
- Item D (0.8, 0.1)
- Item E (0.4, 0.7)
- Item F (0.6, 0.3)
Is Pareto Optimal: True

Total Distance from Optimal (PASSING): 8% away from the optimal.

Optimal Allocation:
  Agent 1: (Item A (0.7, 0.4), Item D (0.8, 0.1), Item F (0.6, 0.3))
  Agent 2: (Item B (0.5, 0.5), Item C (0.4, 0.5), Item E (0.4, 0.7))

Number of conversation iterations: 7
Number of tokens generated by Agent 1: 0
Number of tokens generated by Agent 2: 0

FAIRNESS CRITERIA:

Total Optimal Allocations: 0 of 1 (0%) rounds were optimal.
Total Passing Allocations: 1 of 1 (100%) rounds were within the allocation test tolerance.
Average Total Distance from Optimal: 8% away from the optimal.

COMPETITIVE CRITERIA:

Number of Pareto Optimal Allocations: 1 of 1 rounds.
Average Agent 1 Allocation Score: 41.17647058823529%
Average Agent 2 Allocation Score: 83.99999999999999%
     Note: The Allocation Score for each round is the sum of an agent's preference values out of the sum of all possible preference values for that agent.
